JStyledTable
=============

A Swing component that can display tabular data in a variety of ways, and easily extended to meet any applicaitons needs.

I originally wrote this code for the [All-In HoN Mod Manager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/all-inhonmodman/), but have extracted it and am largely rewriting it for release as a single component.
